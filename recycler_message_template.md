Dear [Recycler Name/Company],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding a partnership opportunity that addresses a common challenge in e-waste recycling while maximizing environmental impact.

**The Opportunity:**
We specialize in refurbishing activation-locked Macs that would otherwise be shredded. These devices represent valuable resources that can be given new life through creative repurposing, parts harvesting, and educational use—all while maintaining complete data security.

**Why This Makes Sense for You:**
- **Zero Data Risk**: Activation-locked devices cannot access stored data—the lock itself provides inherent data protection. Since these devices cannot be unlocked without the original owner's credentials, any data on the drive remains completely inaccessible.
- **Compliance-Friendly**: We understand your data deletion standards. Activation-locked devices present a unique case where physical destruction of drives isn't necessary for data security—the lock itself serves as the security mechanism.
- **Cost Savings**: Instead of paying for shredding/destruction, you can donate these devices and receive tax benefits (if applicable) while reducing processing costs.
- **Environmental Impact**: Every device we refurbish is one less device in a landfill, reducing e-waste and recovering valuable materials.

**Our Approach:**
1. **Data Security First**: We treat all devices as if they contain sensitive data, even though activation lock prevents access. Devices are stored securely and handled with the same care as any data-bearing equipment.
2. **Transparent Use Cases**: 
   - Parts harvesting for repair of other devices
   - Educational workshops and training programs
   - Creative/artistic installations (display purposes, hardware art)
   - Research and development of refurbishment techniques
3. **Documentation**: We provide certificates of receipt and can document the environmental impact of diverted devices.

**What We're Looking For:**
- Activation-locked Macs (any model, any condition)
- Devices that would otherwise be shredded due to activation lock
- Any quantity—we can arrange pickup or shipping

**Our Credentials:**

**Next Steps:**
I'd be happy to discuss how we can structure this partnership to meet your compliance requirements while maximizing environmental benefit. We can provide:
- Written data security protocols
- Liability waivers/agreements
- Documentation of device handling
- Regular impact reports

Would you be available for a brief call this week to discuss this opportunity? I'm happy to answer any questions about our processes, security measures, or compliance considerations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Organization]

## Key Talking Points for Follow-Up Calls:

1. **Address the Data Security Concern Directly:**
   - "I understand your data deletion standards are critical. The unique aspect of activation-locked devices is that the lock itself prevents any data access—it's a built-in security feature that makes these devices safe to transfer without drive destruction."

2. **Emphasize Win-Win:**
   - "This partnership reduces your processing costs while increasing your environmental impact metrics. You're not compromising on security—you're recognizing that activation lock IS the security mechanism."

3. **Provide Reassurance:**
   - "We're happy to sign any agreements you need regarding data handling, liability, and device use. We want this to be a transparent, compliant partnership."

4. **Show Environmental Impact:**
   - "Every Mac we refurbish represents [X] pounds of e-waste diverted, [Y] materials recovered, and [Z] devices given new purpose."
