# Data Security Protocol for Activation-Locked Device Handling

## Purpose
This document outlines our data security protocols for handling activation-locked Mac devices received from e-waste recyclers. These protocols ensure compliance with data protection standards while recognizing that activation lock itself provides inherent data security.

---

## Understanding Activation Lock and Data Security

**Key Fact**: Activation-locked Macs cannot access stored data without the original owner's Apple ID credentials. The activation lock is a hardware-level security feature that:
- Prevents the device from being erased or reset
- Blocks access to the operating system and all stored data
- Cannot be bypassed without the original owner's credentials
- Provides equivalent or superior data protection compared to physical drive destruction

**Implication**: For activation-locked devices, the lock itself serves as the data security mechanism. Physical destruction of drives is not necessary for data protection in these cases.

## Our Data Security Standards

### 1. Receipt and Inventory
- All devices are logged with serial numbers upon receipt
- Devices are immediately placed in secure storage
- Chain of custody documentation is maintained
- No attempt is made to access, unlock, or bypass activation locks

### 2. Storage Security
- Devices stored in locked, access-controlled facilities
- Physical security measures equivalent to data-bearing equipment
- Inventory tracking system for all devices
- Regular security audits

### 3. Handling Procedures
- Devices treated as if they contain sensitive data (even though inaccessible)
- No attempts to remove or access internal storage
- Devices handled only by authorized personnel
- Documentation of all device movements

### 4. Use Cases (Data-Safe Applications)
All refurbishment activities respect the activation lock and do not attempt data access:

**Parts Harvesting:**
- Extraction of non-data-bearing components (screens, keyboards, cases, logic boards for parts)
- Components used to repair other devices
- No access to storage components

**Educational/Artistic Use:**
- Devices used as-is for display, art installations, or educational demonstrations
- Hardware components used for teaching purposes
- No operating system access required

**Research and Development:**
- Study of refurbishment techniques
- Development of parts recovery methods
- No data access attempts

### 5. Disposal of Components
- Any storage components removed during parts harvesting are physically destroyed
- Destruction certificates provided when applicable
- Compliance with NIST SP 800-88 guidelines for any accessible storage media

## Compliance and Documentation

### Certificates Provided:
- Certificate of Receipt (upon device receipt)
- Data Security Assurance Statement
- Chain of Custody Documentation
- Environmental Impact Report (quarterly/annual)

### Agreements Available:
- Data Security Agreement
- Liability Waiver
- Use Restriction Agreement
- Compliance Statement

## Risk Assessment

**Data Access Risk**: **ZERO**
- Activation lock prevents all data access
- No technical means to bypass lock without owner credentials
- Devices treated with same security as data-bearing equipment

**Compliance Risk**: **MINIMAL**
- Protocols exceed standard requirements for locked devices
- Full documentation and transparency
- Willing to adapt to recycler-specific requirements

**Environmental Benefit**: **HIGH**
- Significant e-waste diversion
- Material recovery and reuse
- Extended device lifecycle
